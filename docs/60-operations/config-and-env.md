# Config & `.env` Reference

Configuration is via **pydantic-settings** reading a `.env` file (typed, validated).

## `.env` variables

| Var | Required | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `KITE_API_KEY` | ✅ | `abcd1234` | Kite Connect app key |
| `KITE_API_SECRET` | ✅ | `wxyz5678` | Used to exchange `request_token` → `access_token` |
| `MARKET_DATA_PATH` | ✅ | `/data/MARKET_DATA` | Output root ([[storage-layout]]) |
| `ARCHIVE_DATA_PATH` | ✅ | `/data/z_market_data` | Separate root for verified `.bin.zst` archives |
| `KITE_USER_ID` | login | `AB1234` | Zerodha login id (automated `md-login`) |
| `KITE_PASSWORD` | login | `••••` | Zerodha password (automated `md-login`) |
| `KITE_TOKEN_BROKER_URL` | – | `https://calspread.online/api/kite/token` | Backend-only existing-session lookup; set with passcode |
| `KITE_TOKEN_BROKER_PASSCODE` | – | `••••` | Secret `x-token-passcode`; rotate and set with broker URL |
| `RELEASE_MAINTENANCE_TOKEN` | release | `••••` | At least 32 characters; authenticates the internal capture drain API |
| `RELEASE_MAINTENANCE_TTL_SECONDS` | – | `900` | Persistent drain lease lifetime; release tooling requires 600–900 seconds |
| `RISK_FREE_RATE` | – | `0.0691` | Legacy fallback for the 10-year government bond yield (decimal); staged UI/CLI asks the user to confirm it |
| `KITE_STATIC_IP` | – | `203.0.113.7` | Source IP to bind Kite calls to (static-IP whitelist, Apr 2026) |
| `KITE_HTTP_PROXY` | – | `http://10.0.0.5:3128` | Proxy that egresses from the static IP (alternative to bind) |
| `INDICES` | – | `NIFTY,BANKNIFTY,FINNIFTY,SENSEX` | Index universe (default locked set) |
| `MARKET_HOLIDAYS` | – | `2026-08-15,2026-10-02` | Comma-separated exchange closure dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`); no broker polling, capture, or EOD on these dates |
| `STOCK_UNIVERSE` | – | `all` | `all` or a comma allow-list |
| `CAPTURE_HZ` | – | `1` | Snapshot cadence (default 1) |
| `ZSTD_LEVEL` | – | `17` | EOD compression level |
| `AUTH_POLL_START` / `AUTH_POLL_END` | – | `08:30` / `09:00` | Trading-day shared-token polling window (IST) |
| `AUTH_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | – | `60` | Delay between token-broker attempts inside the auth window |
| `MARKET_OPEN` / `MARKET_CLOSE` | – | `09:00` / `15:30` | Automated capture window (IST; close is exclusive) |
| `TIMEZONE` | – | `Asia/Kolkata` | Exchange timezone |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | – | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |
| `HTTP_HOST` | – | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback bind; use TLS + API authentication before exposing remotely |
| `HTTP_PORT` | ✅ | `9000` | Example seed for the backend HTTP/WS port — **no default**, env-only |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | ✅ | `http://localhost:<frontend-port>` | Frontend origin(s) for CORS and WebSocket Origin checks (comma-separate for many) |

> **Ports are env-only.** `HTTP_PORT` has no code default; start the backend with
> `md-serve` (reads `HTTP_PORT`/`HTTP_HOST`). `FRONTEND_URL` sets the CORS allow-list and
> carries the frontend port, so no port is hardcoded anywhere. On the frontend side,
> `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is the single source for both HTTP and WebSocket URLs and must
> point at `http(s)://<host>:<HTTP_PORT>`.

> The `access_token` is **not** in `.env` — it is obtained by `md-login` and kept in
> session state ([[session-state]]), because it changes daily. The login *credentials*
> (`KITE_USER_ID` / `KITE_PASSWORD`) are seeded from `.env`
> so the automated login can run without a browser (algo_engine keeps these encrypted in
> Postgres; here they come from the environment).

## Private VPS access

There is no separate browser operator-authentication layer. HTTP APIs are reachable to
clients that can reach the backend, and WebSocket handshakes enforce the browser origin
allow-list from `FRONTEND_URL`. CORS and Origin checks are not user authentication, so
bind the backend and frontend only to loopback, Tailscale, or another trusted private
network. The release-maintenance API keeps its dedicated
`X-Release-Maintenance-Token` credential.

## Daily authentication automation

On trading days the backend does not contact the token broker before 08:30. From
08:30 (inclusive) until 09:00 (exclusive), it periodically calls the configured HTTPS
endpoint, validates any returned token directly with Kite, and persists it. Capture
starts at 09:00 only when the token and a permitted 10-year government bond yield are
present. The local TOTP flow remains an explicit operator fallback.

On configured market holidays and weekends, the backend does not poll the broker,
start capture, or run EOD work. Keep `MARKET_HOLIDAYS` synchronized with the official
exchange calendar before each calendar year.

If the backend starts late on a market day, it first validates the most
recent persisted access token. If that token is no longer usable, shared-token polling
continues at the configured interval for the remainder of the capture window; capture
starts automatically as soon as a valid session is available.

The latest yield may be reused on the following Monday–Friday market day. Saturday and
Sunday do not age it. On the third market day (`age >= 2`), capture remains blocked
until the operator confirms a new yield.
Enter yields as decimals, for example `0.0691` for 6.91%.

## Release-maintenance lease

Before replacing the backend container, the release manager acquires
`POST /api/capture/maintenance` with `X-Release-Maintenance-Token`. The backend first
atomically persists a bounded lease under `_state/release-maintenance.json`, then stops
capture and waits for its writer task to flush before returning the opaque `lease_id`.
While the lease is valid, manual and scheduled capture starts are rejected. After the
deployment, the manager releases it with
`DELETE /api/capture/maintenance/<lease_id>`. A lease survives container restart but
expires automatically, so an interrupted deployment cannot block capture indefinitely.

Generate the shared secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Keep it in ignored environment
files and pass it to the request without placing its value in logs or process arguments.

## Manual fallback (`md-login`)

`app/kite/login.py` checks the shared token broker first, falls back to a headless Kite
login when the broker explicitly reports no active session, and writes today's state:

```
md-login                 # or:  python -m app.kite.login
md-login --date 2026-07-21 --rate 0.0691
```

Flow:
1. Backend calls the configured HTTPS broker with `x-token-passcode`. A valid access
   token is verified against Kite with this backend's API key and user id, then skips
   to step 4.
2. On an explicit unauthenticated broker response, `POST /api/login`
   `{user_id, password}` → `request_id`
3. The user enters the **TOTP** in the frontend or terminal; `POST /api/twofa`
   `{user_id, request_id, twofa_value}` verifies it
4. The user confirms the daily risk-free rate
5. For the fallback, `GET /connect/login?v=3&api_key=…` → `request_token`, then
   `POST api.kite.trade/session/token` with `checksum = SHA-256(api_key+request_token+api_secret)`
   → `access_token`, persisted to `_state/session-<date>.json`

All outbound Kite calls go through one client that can **bind `KITE_STATIC_IP`** or use
`KITE_HTTP_PROXY`, satisfying Kite's static-IP whitelist requirement (Apr 2026).

## `.gitignore` (must-haves)

## Settings object (backend)

`app/config.py` exposes a typed `Settings` (pydantic-settings) with the fields above,
plus derived live paths (`indices_dir`, `stocks_dir`, `indices_his_dir`,
`stocks_his_dir`, `instruments_dir`, `state_dir`) rooted at `MARKET_DATA_PATH`.
`ARCHIVE_DATA_PATH` is the separate destination for the same relative market-data
layout after verified zstd compression. Never log secrets.
